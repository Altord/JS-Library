# JS-Library
This library was made for me to practice inheritance. I accidently referred to it as a dictionary due to my tiredness at one point but corrected it 

I had originally thought about just making it fairly simple with pop up boxes and the like, however I wanted it to at least look have decent so I ended up spending much longer than I'd like on the animated aspects of this project.

Regardless it's relatively finished as far as I can tell and as such I'll list the details below:

The naming conventions on this could be better so I'll adjust them when I finished.

##Library Functions
It's a simple library that does the following:

* Add in a new book: Title, Author, Page Count and Read State
* Edit existing books "read-state"
* Remove a book if requested
* Uses local storage to bring up previous books


## Issues

Unfortunately I haven't yet figured out how to fully edit the entries but I'll work on that later if I want to come back to this project.

There's also a slight issue in local memory where it doesn't properly remove an item so it ends up not fully deleting items
